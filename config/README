Targets for the symlink config.yaml in the top level directory.

Files in this dir correspond to the name of the current branch.

The symlink is switched in git checkout. See:

  bin/switch-branch
  
  .git/hooks/post-checkout

When you first clone the repository, you must do:

  rake git:init

which will set up this hook file. (Unfortunately, hooks are not part of the files tracked by git.)
