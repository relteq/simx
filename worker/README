The end-to-end procedure for calibration is as follows:

client sends data (xml) to apiweb, requesting s3 storage(*)
  with expiry param

apiweb stores it under md5hash of the data, returns url to it

client requests calibration of that url

calibrator runs and uses (*) again for output xml

calibrator sends url as result value in finish message to runq

client polls apiweb for status of batch
  url: /batch/n/done

when batch done, client reads result
  url: /batch/n/run/0/result

result is url to calibrated xml
